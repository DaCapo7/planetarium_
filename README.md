# Planetarium
> A full python simulation of gravitational interaction between planets of different mass and size, colliding in an elastic way.

Hi ! Here is an initially little project that became kinda bigger due to the time it took in order to resolve all the problems (especially with threading and collisions).

It's fully in python, easily editable and easily usable.

## Installation
* First download main.py
* Then install these requirements after having pyhton 3.10 installed (it should work with numerous previous versions but I haven't tested them yet)
```py
pip install requirements.txt
```
* The project also uses sys, math, random, tkinter and threading : pre-installed libs

## Usage
When you launch the program, the simulation is automatically on pause : here are some example steps to make a simple simulation :
* Click anywhere on the simulatin screen (big black square)
* A new window should appear : there you can choose setting for the planet to add : x, y, ray, material, initial velocity...
* Then click on "Create planet" and a new planet will appear (any field let blank will complete automatically with random value)
* After adding a few planets you can click on play on the Live Control Pad and the simulation should start
* You are also able to change the time speed with "+" and "-" button at the top of the LCP
* Click apply after all changes on LCP except for "play" and "pause"
* Now you can change the scale of the simulation by scrolling and even move the camera with arrows

## Functionning
At each frame, each planet's speed vector is edited according to all gravitational interactions with all other planets using newton laws. Every time a collision happens, elastic collision rules are applied (no energy is lost). The program is multi-threaded : thread-1 is for the simultation and thread-2 is for the LCP (otherwise tkinter (that hanles LCP) stops pygame (that handles the simulation))

## Demo
